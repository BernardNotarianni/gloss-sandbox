Rules.

Nobody is allowed to speak, comment and explain what is happening, especially
the code being written.

Debriefing and commenting happen at the end of the session.


Teacher's turn
- The teacher writes some lines of code
- The code is executed
- We observe the result
- The teacher deletes the code he added

Each participant in turn performs the following steps:
- Repeat what the teacher just did
- If you are not sure what to do, say so immediatly.
  It just means the exercice is badly designed.
- Obverse the result
- Delete the added code

Participants are allowed to do something different than the teacher, to
introduce some variation. Participants that choose to do so must first describe
the outcome they expect to see.
